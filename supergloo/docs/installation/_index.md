title: Installing Supergloo
---

In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to install SuperGloo onto your Kubernetes cluster and some basic functionality you can use once installed.

## Dependencies

First, you’ll need a Kubernetes cluster running 1.9 or later, and a functioning [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) command (tested with client version 1.12) on your local machine. 

To run Kubernetes on your local machine, we suggest [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) — running version 0.24.1 or later. (tested with 0.28.2-0.30.0)

You also need to install the [Helm client](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#install-helm) (tested with 2.11).

## Install the CLI

If this is your first time running SuperGloo, you’ll need to download the command-line interface (CLI) onto your local machine. You’ll use this CLI to interact with SuperGloo, including installing it onto your Kubernetes cluster.

To install the CLI, run:

```
curl -sL https://run.solo.io/supergloo/install | sh
```

Alternatively, you can download the CLI directly via the [SuperGloo releases page](https://github.com/solo-io/supergloo/releases).

Next, add SupetGloo to your path with:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.supergloo/bin
```

Verify the CLI is installed and running correctly with:

```
supergloo --version
```


## Install SuperGloo onto the cluster

```
supergloo init
```

### Install a new service mesh

Supergloo supports Istio, Consul, and Linkerd2. To install them with default configuration, run the following command:

```
supergloo install -m {meshname} -n {namespace} -s
```

`{meshname}` should be one of `consul`, `istio`, or `linkerd2`. <BR>
`{namespace}` is a namespace where the mesh control plane will be deployed. <BR> 
Supergloo will create this namespace if it doesn't already exist. 

For instance, to deploy `istio` into the `istio-system` namespace, run: 

```
supergloo install -m istio -n istio-system -s
```

Full CLI documentation can be found [**here**](cli)


### Enabling AppMesh Support

In order to use Supergloo with AWS AppMesh, it's necessary to create an IAM Role with AWS AppMesh admin privileges. Documentation on 
doing so can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/MESH_IAM_user_policies.html.

This role should be attached to the IAM user linked to the AWS credentials that you provide to Supergloo as a kubernetes secret.
